				<p><font size=70><b>S</b></font>teven Gallanter, a longtime Boston resident, does not plan on ever leaving
  the Burbank Apartments in East Fenway if he can help it.</p>

<p>"I've lived here since 1978," said the 58-year-old bartender. "It's a great
  location. They've got laundry in the building, all the basics you are looking
  for are here. On the rare occasion that I've had problems, things are fixed
  the next day at the latest."
  
<p>But in 2011, his housing situation was threatened when landlord Bill Kargman
chose to withdraw from a Section 8 rental subsidy program with the federal
government. The 171 Burbank apartment units, at 18 Haviland St., have provided
safe and affordable housing to low-income famlies, the elderly, and people
with disabilities for the last 40 years. Under the program, according to the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development's website, the Public Housing Authority
pays the landlord the difference between 30 percent of the household's adjusted
income and the unit's rent. On April 1, 2011, Kargman began to rent the units at
market rate.</p>

<p>Gallanter and other Burbank tenants formed the Burbank Apartment Tenants
  Association (BATA) and sued, with the Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless
  and the Fenway Community Development Corporation named as co-plaintiffs.
  "We realized that we were on our own against a fairly powerful realtor," said
  Gallanter. </p>

  <p>While they lost the trial, the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law
  and the Lawyers Committee of Civil Rights and Economic Justice are currently
  appealing the decision on the bassis that Kargman's choice to opt out of the
  program not ony has a "discriminatory impact on minority tenants but will also
  perpetuate and exacerbate residential segregation in the Fenway neighborhood."</p>

<p>The tenants in the Burbank Apartments are not alone. There are numerous
  examples of Section 8 Housing contracts expiring and leaving tenants stranded
  across the city and nation. In 2006, High Point Village was an affordable
  apartment community in Roslindale, financed through federal subsidies with many
  of its tenants receiving project-based Section 8 rental assistance. In September
  2006, High Point's subsidy program expired. When a subsidy program expires,
  residents already living in a building can continue living there while paying
  their subsidized rents. But once they move out, the units can be rented out at
  market rate. Today, the apartments, now renamed Stony Brook Commons, are all
  sold at market rate. According to Stony Brooks' website, a studio apartment can
  be rented for up to $1,828 and a one-bedroom apartment can be rented for up to
  $2,054. All 320 affordable units in the 540-unit community have been lost. Bill
	Kargman was also the landlord at High Point Village.</p></div>

<p><font size=70><b>I</b></font>n Worcester, Mountain Village was an apartment community for low-income tenants.
  In January 2010, the subsidy program expired. Now renamed the Fairway Apartments,
  only 60 of the 200 units are still under Section 8 contracts.</p>

<p>For more than 40 years in Brookline, the Brookline Cooperative Housing offered
  116 affordable housing units to mostly town employees. In 2006, when the
  subsidy program expired, the development’s manager renegotiated the contract
  to begin selling units at market rate. Today, 84 of the units are sold at
  market rate. </p>

<p>“The whole subsidized rental market is in trouble,” said Richard Giordiano,
  the community organizing director at Fenway CDC. “If we lose hundreds more of
  Section 8 subsidized apartments, it would be a disaster. There are no new
  Section 8 [housing projects] being put out, they’re just being recycled…this
  means thousands of poor people, poor families, could lose their apartments and
  become homeless.” </p>

<p>	Academics and affordable housing advocates call this the “Year 40 Problem.”
  Starting in the 1960s, the federal government started to experiment with a
  different way of delivering social housing, says Alexander von Hoffman, a
  senior fellow at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at AT Harvard University.
  Nonprofits and for-profits could acquire an existing property or build a new
  property and receive subsidies. </p>

<p>“These private entities could use government funds to develop and manage low-
  or moderate-income housing,” said Hoffman, who is currently writing a book on
  the history of low-income policy in the U.S.</p>

<p><font size=70><b>A</b></font>ccording to a 2011 report titled “Year 40 Problem in Massachusetts: Analysis
  of the First Wave of Housing Projects” by Bill Brauner, the housing preservation
  program manager at the organization’s Community Economic Development Assistance
  Corporation (CEDAC), nearly 1 million affordable rental housing units were
  produced in the United States through federally assisted mortgage programs that
  tied affordability restrictions to below market rate 40-year mortgages. Now, with
  many of these contracts reaching maturity, these affordable units are eligible
  to be turned into market rate. CEDAC found that of the nearly 3,800 apartment
  units that have reached the end of their 40-year mortgages in Massachusetts,
  89 percent of those lost some or all of their affordable units. </p>

<p>	CEDAC also found that, in Massachusetts, another 13,200 apartment units will
  reach the end of their 40-year mortgages by the end of the decade.</p>

<p>	Giordiano says that once these affordable units are converted to market rate
  units, they cannot be replaced. “As this all began to unfold a couple years ago,
  people realized, ‘oh my god, this is tens of thousands of rental units that
  we’re going to lose and are no longer going to be affordable, going to be
  market-rate’.” </p>

				<center>"We're losing things, what's getting produced isn't affordable... what happens 
          to just regular Joe Schmoes?"
				 </p></font></b></center>

<p>Kathy Naczas, the senior community investment manager at the Federal Home
  Loan Bank of Boston, said that part of the onus might be on the Department of
  Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for making promises to private owners who
  entered these contracts, only to backpedal when the contracts began expiring. </p>

<p>“HUD tried to rely on the private market to generate affordable housing or
  subsidized housing with the promise that when the person wanted to opt out of
  the project they could do that,” said Naczas, who works primarily with
  developers in western Massachusetts. “Now we are approaching these deadlines
  and HUD is saying, ‘well, now you can’t just opt out of the contract like we
  said. You have to sell it to a nonprofit eligible buyer who is going to
  continue the affordability’…but that was never part of the original deal.”</p>

<p>Naczas believes HUD did not anticipate creating this housing crisis, saying
  “I think HUD thought these time period contracts were so far out that they
  weren’t going to worry about it.” Further, it does not surprise her that the
  Burbank tenants lost their case, because of “these contractual promises that
  were made to these private developers.”</p>

<p>The problem, Giordiano says, is three-fold. “No new subsidized housing is
  being produced, we’re losing subsidized housing as we speak, and in general
  rents are still going up in the area. So, we’re losing things, what’s getting
  produced isn’t affordable, and rents are going up…so what happens to just
  regular Joe Schmoes?”</p>

<p>Gallanter says that some people have had to move out of the Burbank
  Apartments. “Some have moved naturally, some have been squeezed out…it’s been
	a slow process.”</p></div>
  
<div class="cd-fixed-bg cd-bg-4"> </div>
<div class="text1">
  
  <p><font size=70><b>N</b></font>aczas says that the loss of economic diversity in Massachusetts’
  neighborhoods could be detrimental. “When you don’t have a variety of types of
  housing and housing that’s priced to meet a diverse group, then you either have
  a concentration of very low crappy housing in a particular neighborhood or you
  have really high-cost housing that moves all the other people that essentially
  need to be working in that area elsewhere.”</p>

<p>This type of housing situation can increase class and social tensions, Naczas
  added. “It’s not a healthy way for your community to function…if you have a
  diverse economy and housing that meets everyone’s needs, there tends to be more
  stability in the community. Bad things don’t happen when you are meeting
  everyone’s needs in terms of housing.” </p>

<p>With the Massachusetts Supreme Justice Court’s decision on the Burbank
  Apartments Tenants Association’s appeal due soon, many believe the case has
  the potential to change an important aspect of housing discrimination and
  property development in Massachusetts. Advocates like Giordiano hope the
  decision will offer some guidance on how to deal with the ensuing “40-year
  problem.” </p>

<p>“The CDC believes it’s very important,” said Giordiano. “This case could be
  precedent setting in that it may provide a solution for what’s happened in the
  loss of affordable apartments all over the city and the state.”</p>

<p>Kelly Turley, the director of legislative advocacy at Massachusetts Coalition
  for the Homeless, said that the loss of affordable housing in Massachusetts
  will most effect the elderly, people with disabilities, and low-income
  families. “We are losing the people who make up the rich fabric of our
  communities.”</p>
